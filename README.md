- **Listed_in**: The genre or category of the content.
- **Description**: A brief summary or description of the content.

## Project Workflow

1. **Problem Definition**:
   - Clearly define the business goals: identifying the content types to produce and strategies for expanding in different countries.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyze basic metrics, such as the distribution of movies/TV shows and genre counts.
   - Perform both graphical and non-graphical analysis of key variables.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing data, outliers, and necessary data type conversions.
   - Unnest columns such as Actor, Director, and Country, where needed.

4. **Analysis Goals**:
   - Investigate the types of content available in different countries.
   - Examine trends in movie releases over the last 20-30 years.
   - Compare TV shows vs. movies.
   - Analyze actor and director involvement in different genres.

5. **Visual Analysis**:
   - **Univariate Analysis**: Use distplots, histograms, and countplots to understand the distribution of individual variables.
   - **Bivariate Analysis**: Perform correlation analysis using heatmaps and pairplots.
   - **Categorical Analysis**: Use boxplots to analyze relationships between categorical variables.

6. **Insights**:
   - Provide insights on content distribution, release trends, and focus areas for Netflix based on the analysis.

7. **Recommendations**:
   - Offer actionable, data-driven business recommendations. Avoid technical jargon and focus on straightforward suggestions for content creation and regional growth strategies.
